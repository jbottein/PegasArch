# PegasArch by jeantichoc
PegasArch is bash script to transform an [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) machine into a functionnal retro-gaming console plateform. I wanted here to propose something simple for any Ubuntu setups that could sync games and saves on any clouds with [rclone](https://rclone.org), with [retroarch](https://www.retroarch.com) for the emulation part, [pegasus](https://pegasus-frontend.org) as the frontend, and [screenscraper](https://www.screenscraper.fr) as the metadata provider through [skyscraper](https://github.com/muldjord/skyscraper).


# Installation

Copy/paste into a terminal :
```
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeantichoc/PegasArch/master/init/update.sh | bash
```
